Changes to the base directory caused changes in the rendered manifests.
These changes often change all (or many) environments at once.
Please consider the effect of changing multiple environments at once.
E.g. Adding a label to a pod, might seem trivial,
but that means that all pods in all clusters will be changed simultaniously.
